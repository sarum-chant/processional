name: Venite venite venite;
cantus: 205144;
commentary: Rylands-24:180; GS:94; 1519:53v\footnote{In 1525--55r. Man:16r, GS:94, Grad-1508:94r, and Rylands-24:180.1519:53v the third repetition of `Veníte' is set F.F.GA. In the missals, manuals and graduals---except 1508---the third `Veníte' comes only with the continuation of the antiphon. The edition follows here. It would seem, however, that the missal version is both older and superior, and that the processional version represents a simplification that was probably employed widely in practice. In GS:94 `Dómini' is set B♭.GF.F. In GS:94 and 1524:55r docébo' is set FGAG.A.G. In 1519:43v, 1528:50r, and Grad-1508:94r `docébo' is set FG.A.GFG. Here the edition follows Rylands-24:180. Rylands-24:180 uses not the psalm tone but rather the officium tone: F G A--- GB♭ A A AG GA: GF.GA A--- F GA G F.};
