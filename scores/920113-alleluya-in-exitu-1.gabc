cantus: 920113;
commentary: Rylands-24:212; 1519:92v; AS:239; Ant-1519:219v; Brev-1531:127v.\footnote{It should be noted that the text setting of the first `Allelúya' differs from those that follow. Rylands-24:212. gives only a single `Allelúya', at the beginning; it is set E.GAGFE.DE.E. Perhaps in earlier days the first Allelúya' would have been treated like the incipit of an antiphon, and sung by the cantor only. Rylands-24:212. gives only the first verse of the psalm. In verse 1: Rylands-24:212. `de Egypto' is set E E.D.C. In 1519:103r. in verse 15. `gútture' is set F.F.E; verse 19. has `speravérunt'; in verse 21. `Israel' is set D.D.C; in verse 23. `a Dómino' is st D D.C.C; in verse 27. `Dómino' is set D.D.C; in the `Glória Patri' `Fílio' is set D.D.C.};
